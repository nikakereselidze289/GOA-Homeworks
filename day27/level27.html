        LeBron Raymone James Sr. is an American professional basketball player
        for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
        Nicknamed "King James", he is widely regarded as one of the greatest
        basketball players of all time, and is frequently at the center of
        debates regarding the sport's all-time best, often being compared to
        Michael Jordan.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA
        Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between
        2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the
        Lakers, three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team,
        and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being
        the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career
        assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual
        honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP
        Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP
        Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA
        All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20
        times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the
        All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and
        was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in
        his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with
        Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history,
        with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA
        history. [7]
